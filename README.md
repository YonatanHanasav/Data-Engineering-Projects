# Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end data engineering pipelines, including both real-time streaming and batch ETL workflows.

Each folder represents a standalone project with its own setup, tools, and documentation. The projects demonstrate use of cloud services, orchestration tools, and containerization for scalable data workflows.
