# Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end data engineering projects, to demonstrate my experience.

Each folder represents a standalone project with its own setup, tools, and documentation. The projects demonstrate use of cloud services, orchestration tools, and containerization for scalable data workflows.

## Projects

### [AWS Reddit Streaming Pipeline](./aws-reddit-streaming-pipeline)
Real-time Reddit ingestion pipeline using AWS (Kinesis, Lambda, S3), built on the free tier.
